what needs to be updated in `pages/home/index.html`:

### Current Placeholder Structure:

```html
<!-- Jewellery Card (currently orange placeholder) -->
<div
    style="background: orange; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center"
>
    <span style="font-size: 4rem">💎</span>
</div>
```

### Should Become:

    src="../../assets/images/industries/jewellery_industry.jpg"
    alt="Jewellery & Gold Industry"
    style="width: 100%; height: 100%; object-fit: cover"
